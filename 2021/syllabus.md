- Before each lab, you will be asked to complete an online quiz that tests your understanding of the programming concepts that you have learned so far. 
#### Throughout the week
- Prepare for next week’s labs and live classes by going through asynchronous materials (lecture videos, articles, websites, etc.) and read one chapter each week in the Spiegelhalter textbook. 
- Work on weekly homework assignments, which include finishing your lab notebooks, programming exercises, and work for your group project. 
- Schedule office hours with the TFs to get help with the labs and homework assignments.
- Overall, expect to spend about 10 hours on asynchronous materials, homework, and project work outside of labs and classes. 
#### Sunday
- Hand in your homework assignments, lab notebooks, and project milestones.
- Watch a quick video (2-3 min) to get an idea of what we will cover each week.



### Limited Enrollment 
To provide the best possible online learning experience during live classes we have limited enrollment in the course. If you are interested in joining this course please fill out the [enrollment survey](https://forms.gle/3pVCgxxShoxm3DxE7)  between January 13 and January 18, 2021. We will notify you by January 20 before the course registration deadline on January 21. 


### Prerequisites

This course has NO prerequisites. However, please be aware that learning data science and a new programming language like Python is a time-consuming process! This course is intended for students without programming experience. The purpose of the weekly labs is to introduce basic programming concepts at a high level. By the end of the semester, students will be equipped with the programming skills required to carry out a data science project in Python using Google Colab.


### Textbooks
You will be reading one chapter each week in the required textbook for this class to cover data science methodologies.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/books.png)

We will be using one required textbook for this class to cover data science methodologies and an optional reference book for data science programming in Python.

[The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), by David Spiegelhalter (**Required**)
David Spiegelhalter draws on real-world examples to introduce concepts from statistics and data science. The book also gives a good overview of many of the ethical issues that come up in data science. You can purchase the book from the Coop bookstore or any other online retailer.

An optional reference book for data science programming in Python:
[Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Science-Handbook-Essential/dp/1491912057/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=data+science+python&qid=1579027726&s=books&sr=1-4), by Jake VanderPlas (Optional). We are providing Python notebooks that will cover all the programming material that you need for this course. However, if you are interested in delving deeper into Python as a data science programming language, we recommend this book.


## Course Components

DS10 has four main threads:
- Discussions of real-life case studies that show the data science process at work.
- Learning fundamental methods and tools of data science.
- Weekly labs to teach you Python programming skills for data science.
- Practicing the data science process by conducting projects from beginning to end. 


### Live Classes

The class meets every Tuesday during a live Zoom call for joint class activities. Attending these live sessions is mandatory and a crucial component of learning the material in this course. Please arrive on time, as we will start promptly. Before each class, you will be asked to complete an online quiz that tests your understanding of the asynchronous materials for that week. At the end of each class, we will ask you to fill out and submit a one-minute reflection to collect feedback.


### Programming Labs

You will attend mandatory online programming labs on Thursdays. Labs are interactive tutorials using notebooks that give you an introduction to programming data science in Python. You are allowed to work in pairs, and TFs will be available to help you. Completed lab notebooks need to be handed in with the homework each week. Solutions to labs will be made public the week after the lab has been published. Before each lab, you will be asked to complete a quiz that tests your understanding of the programming concepts you learned so far. At the end of each lab, we will ask you to fill out and submit a one-minute reflection to collect feedback.

### Asynchronous Materials
In preparation for class each week, you will work on your own through asynchronous materials (lecture videos, websites, articles, book chapters, etc.) to ensure that you are prepared for the activities in class and the programming labs. You are expected to read and watch these materials posted on Canvas each week. 


### Homework
Weekly homework assignments are going to provide an opportunity to improve your data science and programming skills. Homework is due every Sunday. See the homework as an opportunity to learn, and not to “earn points”. Each student needs to hand in their own homework solution and adhere to our collaboration policy (see below). You can discuss solutions to homework assignments with your TFs during office hours, they will not be posted publicly.


### Group Projects
A big part of the course will be group projects. You will work in teams of 2-3 students to conduct two data science projects with a series of graded milestones over the course of several weeks (see course schedule). First, you will work on a guided project in random teams assigned by us. The guided project will familiarize you with the data science process. After the guided project, you will work on a final project for which you can choose your own team. You can either choose to continue to work on your guided project, or you can propose a new data science project of your choice. A small number of projects will win a Best Project prize (Swiss chocolate) at the end of the semester.

### Peer Assessments
Assessment of your participation in the projects is challenging. We will use peer evaluation to allow you to assess the members of your project teams as well as yourself. Peer assessments will count towards your project grades. 

### Office Hours & Piazza
The teaching fellows will provide online office hours at several different times each week for questions you may have. We will use Piazza as our discussion forum and for all announcements, so it is important that you are signed up as soon as possible. Piazza should always be your first resource for seeking answers to your questions. You can also post privately so that only the course staff sees your message.


### Grading
This course can be taken for a letter grade only, there is no pass/fail option. The course grade comprises:

Participation (20%)
Quizzes (10%)
Homework Assignments (20%)
Guided Project (25%)
Final Project (25%)

Group projects receive team grades. In general, we do not anticipate that the grades for each team member will be different. However, we reserve the right to assign different grades to each team member based on peer assessments (see above).

Your participation grade includes watching lecture videos, participation in live classes, submitting one-minute reflections, and being helpful to other students on Piazza and during labs. We will drop your lowest quiz score. Any concerns about grading errors must be clearly articulated in writing and sent to sabdelmagid@g.harvard.edu <staff@ds10.org> within one week of receiving the grade.









### Readings & Quizzes

Each lecture includes required readings to ensure that you are prepared for the activities in class. You are expected to complete the assigned readings before class. Short online quizzes given at the beginning of each class will test your knowledge of the readings. Reading quizzes are part of your final grade.

### Homework

Weekly homework assignments are going to provide an opportunity to improve your data science and programming skills. See the homework as an opportunity to learn, and not to “earn points”. The homework will be graded holistically to reflect this objective. Each student needs to hand in their own homework solution and adhere to our collaboration policy (see below).

### Design Sprint

A big part of the lectures will be a design sprint. You will work in groups of 2-3 students to ask questions, explore data, and communicate your findings for a given topic and pre-defined dataset over the course of several weeks. The design sprint is good practice for the final project for which you will be using the same process. Your team will submit graded design sprint milestones as part of your homework.

### Final Project

A major part of the course is a final data science project. You will work in small groups of 2-3 students to complete a data science project that answers questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will follow the same design sprint process that we introduced in class. The final result will be a Python notebook and a data story (article) with a 2-minute video that communicate your project findings to a general audience. A small number of projects will win a Best Project prize.

### Peer Assessment

Assessment of your participation in the projects for a large class is challenging. We will use peer evaluation to allow you to assess the members of your project teams as well as yourself. Peer assessment is an element of the final project (and thus part of your project grade).

## Course Policies

### Grading

This course can be taken for a letter grade only, there is no pass/fail option. The course grade comprises:
- Participation (20%)
- Labs (10%)
- Homework Assignments (20%)
- Design Sprint (15%)
- Group Project (35%) (including peer assessment)

Participation includes reading quizzes, lecture attendance, participating in in-class activities, and submitting one-minute reflections.

We will drop your lowest reading quiz score and your lowest homework grade.

Design sprint and group project receive team grades. In general, we do not anticipate that the grades for each group member will be different. However, we reserve the right to assign different grades to each group member based on peer assessments (see above).

### Regrading Policy

Any concerns about grading errors must be noted in writing. Requests for regrading have to be submitted **within 2 days** of when you received your graded assignment. Use a dedicated private channel on Piazza and explain in detail why you are requesting a regrade. We will reply within a week. Use the same thread to communicate about this request. Please note that regrading may also result in you losing points. 

### Due Dates & Late Policy

No submissions (labs, homework, quizzes, project milestones, etc.) will be accepted for credit after the deadline. Homeworks will be posted on Fridays and will be due the following Friday. Lab notebooks are due on Mondays. All submissions are due at 11:59 pm EST on the due date.

If you have a verifiable medical condition that interferes with your coursework please let us know as soon as possible. You will need to provide a written note from a medical professional confirming your inability to participate in course work.

### Collaboration Policy

We expect you to adhere to the {Harvard Honor Code}[URL] at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board.

You may discuss your homework and labs with other students in the class, but you are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. In particular:
- You have to write your homework solutions entirely on your own.
- You cannot share written materials or code for homework with anyone else.
- You may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another course.
- You may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future.
- You may use third-party libraries and example code so long as you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers.

### Devices in Class

We will use smartphones and laptops throughout the course to facilitate activities and project work in-class. However, research and student feedback clearly shows that using devices on non-class related activities not only harms your own learning, but other students’ learning as well. Therefore, we only allow device usage during activities that require devices. At all other times, you should not be using your device.

### Accessibility

Any student receiving accommodations through the Accessible Education Office should email or present their AEO letter to one of the instructors as soon as possible. Failure to do so may prevent us from making appropriate arrangements.

## Course Resources

### Online Materials

All class handouts, slides, homework, labs, and required readings will be posted on Canvas.

### Discussion Forum

We use Piazza as our discussion forum and for all announcements, so it is important that you are signed up as soon as possible. Piazza should always be your first resource for seeking answers to your questions. You can also post privately so that only the staff sees your message.

### Office Hours

The TFs will provide office hours for questions that you might have throughout the semester. As office hours are usually heavily attended, please consult Piazza as a first option to get help.

### Credits

This course has been developed by the instructors together with Salma Abu Ayash, Salma Abdel Magid, Allen Downey, Robert Haussman, and Aditya Ranganathan. Hanspeter Pfister has received generous support to develop this course through a 2019 [SEAS Learning Incubator](https://linc.seas.harvard.edu) fellowship. All lab notebooks were developed by [Prof. Allen Downey](http://www.allendowney.com/wp/), who spent fall 2019 as a visitor at Harvard and heavily influenced the design of the course for the better. The course design greatly benefited from the students who took the 2019 Harvard [STAT250 course](https://stat250.org/2019/). We have drawn on materials and examples found online and tried our best to give credit by citing the original sources. Please contact us if you find materials where credit is missing or that you would rather have removed.
